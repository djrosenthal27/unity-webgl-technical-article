<h1>How do I make a Unity game playable in a desktop browser?</h1>

<hr>

<p>
The <b>Unity engine</b> offers developers the ability to create <b>WebGL builds</b> of their games, making 2D and 3D games playable in most major web browsers. These builds alleviate the need for players to install plug-ins or download files for a game to be played. This article explains how Unity developers can build desktop browser games with WebGL and host them on the web.
</p>

<p>
This article applies to all Unity Editor versions from 2019.3 and on, as well as all Unity Hub versions from 3.0 and on.
</p>

<p>
<i><b>Note:</b> WebGL provides gameplay support for any platform with a browser, which includes many mobile and console platforms. However, WebGL builds are most efficient for desktop games that aren't graphically demanding, so this article is intended for such games.</i>

<h2 id="install">Install WebGL build module</h2>

<p>
When a version of the Unity Editor is installed, the WebGL build module is not automatically included with it. The following steps ensure the <b>WebGL Build Support module</b> is added to your editor.
</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Open</b> Unity Hub and <b>select</b> 'Projects' on the sidebar.</li><br>
<li><b>Find</b> the project you want to make playable in the browser and <b>identify</b> its editor version.</li><br>
<img src="images/iwbm1.png" alt="Install Image 1"><br><br>
<li><b>Select</b> 'Installs' on the sidebar and <b>find</b> the Unity Editor install corresponding to the version used in your project. </li><br>
<li>If a 'WebGL' label appears under the install's file path, then <a href="#configure">you're ready to configure your project's build settings.</a></li><br>
<img src="images/iwbm2.png" alt="Install Image 2"><br><br>
<li>If the Unity Editor install doesn't have a 'WebGL' label, <b>click</b> the install's settings icon, then <b>select</b> 'Add modules'.</li><br>
<img src="images/iwbm3.png" alt="Install Image 3"><br><br>
<li>In the popup window that appears, <b>check</b> the 'WebGL Build Support' option listed under 'Platforms', then <b>click</b> the blue 'Install' button.</li><br>
<img src="images/iwbm4.png" alt="Install Image 4"><br><br>
<li>In the Downloads window, your project's Unity Editor install should be listed under 'Active' while the WebGL Build Support module downloads. Once the module is finished downloading, the install will move under 'Recent'.</li><br>

</ol>

<hr>
<h2 id="configure">Configure build settings</h2>

<p>
With the WebGL Build Support module installed, your project can be turned into a WebGL build.</p>

<ol>
<li>In the Unity Hub, <b>select</b> 'Projects' and <b>open</b> the project you want to make playable in the browser.</li><br>
<li>In the Unity Editor, <b>select</b> 'File > Build Settings...' from the menu bar to open the Build Settings window. Alternatively, you can <b>use</b> the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+B to open the window.</li><br>
<img src="images/cbs1.png" alt="Configure Image 1"><br><br>
<li>Under the Platform panel, <b>choose</b> the 'WebGL' option. If there isn't a Unity logo on the right side of the 'WebGL' option, <b>click</b> the 'Switch Platform' button. When the project is done switching platforms, the Unity logo will appear next to 'WebGL' in the Platform panel.</li><br>
<img src="images/cbs2.png" alt="Configure Image 2"><br><br>
<li>With the project configured to the WebGL platform, you can change settings such as texture compression, code optimization, and maximum texture size to your liking.</li><br>
<i><b>Note:</b> Clicking 'Player Settings...' in the bottom-left corner will open a window with dozens of settings options. Although out of the scope of this article, you can read about them <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/Manual/class-PlayerSettingsWebGL.html">in Unity's documentation.</a></i><br><br>
<img src="images/cbs3.png" alt="Configure Image 3"><br><br>
<li><b>Ensure</b> that all of the scenes you want in your game appear in the 'Scenes In Build' panel with a checkmark and index number next to them. Scenes can be added to the build by dragging them from the Unity Editor's Project window into the 'Scenes In Build' panel, or by opening the scenes and clicking 'Add Open Scenes' below the 'Scenes In Build' panel. The scene with index 0 will appear first when the game is launched.</li><br>

<h2 id="bpw">Build and publish a game on the web</h2>

<p>
Developers can choose between numerous websites for hosting their WebGL games, including their own websites. The two choices discussed in this article are <b>itch.io</b> and <b>Unity Play</b>. </p>

<p>
Many independent game developers use <a href="https://itch.io/">itch.io</a> because it allows games to be monetized, supports both downloadable and browser games, and doesn't restrict which engines can be used to create games hosted on the site. </p>

<p>
<a href="https://play.unity.com/">Unity Play</a> is less popular and only supports WebGL builds created with Unity, but its integration into the Unity Engine enables a simple and automated method of uploading games to the site. </p>

<h3 id="bpi">Build and publish a game on itch.io</h3>

<h4>Build the game</h4>

<ol>
<li>In the Unity Editor, <b>open</b> the Build Settings window using 'File > Build Settings...' from the menu bar, or by using Ctrl+Shift+B.</li><br>
<li>With 'WebGL' selected in the Platform panel, <b>click</b> 'Build'.</li><br>
<img src="images/bgi1.png" alt="Build Itch Image 1"><br><br>
<li>A popup window for your computer's file system will appear. <b>Create</b> an appropriately named folder for your build data, then <b>select</b> it.</li><br>
<i><b>Note:</b> The build folder can go in your project's root folder, but it cannot be placed in the 'Assets' folder.</i> <br><br>
<img src="images/bgi2.png" alt="Build Itch Image 2"><br><br>
<li>Once the game is finished building, <b>find</b> the build folder in your file system and <b>compress</b> it into a ZIP file. The steps for compressing a folder into a ZIP file vary by operating system.</li><br>
